### How to start

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app (Server for serving client and server for accessing local filesystem).<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

For simple deployment on a local machine you can install serve to setup a static server.

#### `npm install -g serve`

#### `serve -s build -l 3000`

Where `-s` flag designates build folder and `-l` flag designates port <br/>
